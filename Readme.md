# 🛠️ DevOps Engineering Patterns: Modular, Scalable CI/CD Orchestration

Welcome! This repository is a hands-on, production-inspired reference for building, testing, and deploying modern applications using clean, modular, and flexible CI/CD pipelines. It demonstrates best practices for DevOps engineers—from automation and security to monitoring and collaboration—across multiple tech stacks and environments.

> **Status:** The repository is in active development, building out reusable patterns, composable GitHub Actions, and real-world workflow examples.

---

## 📌 Core DevOps Responsibilities Demonstrated

1. **Automating CI/CD Pipelines**  
   Fast, reliable, and repeatable build, test, and deploy for every code change.

2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
   Versioned, automated, and scalable infrastructure with tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, or Pulumi.

3. **System Reliability and Monitoring**  
   Logging, metrics, alerting, and incident response to maximize uptime and performance.

4. **Security Best Practices**  
   Secrets management, access controls, and secure-by-default configurations throughout the pipeline.

5. **Cross-Team Collaboration**  
   Integrations and workflows to support developers, QA, and IT in shared delivery and operations.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Provide **modular, environment-aware, and production-ready CI/CD workflows**
- Support **frontend, backend, infrastructure, database, and ML projects**
- Use **GitHub Actions** for automation and orchestration
- Enable **multi-environment promotion** (dev → uat → staging → prod)
- Model **best practices** in automation, security, testing, rollback, and notifications
- Serve as a learning, onboarding, and reference resource for DevOps engineers

## 🔧 What's Included

- **Reusable Actions & Workflows**  
  Common CI/CD steps abstracted into modular, DRY GitHub Actions and reusable workflows.

- **App Simulations**  
  Each `apps/` subdirectory simulates a standalone application (e.g., Next.js, Nuxt.js, Python, Node.js, ML).

- **CI/CD Examples**  
  End-to-end, real-world pipelines for building, testing, and deploying different app types.

- **Documentation**  
  Guides on structure, usage, best practices, extensibility, and examples.

## 🚦 CI/CD Pipeline Steps

### Continuous Integration (CI)

1. **Checkout code**
2. **Install dependencies**
3. **Lint / static analysis**
4. **Unit & integration tests**
5. **Build application (e.g., Docker image, binary, package)**
6. **Package & publish artifact**

### Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)

1. **Fetch artifact**
2. **Deploy to environment** (dev, staging, prod, etc.)
3. **Run smoke/sanity tests**
4. **Apply deployment strategy** (rolling, blue/green, canary, etc.)
5. **Monitor deployment** (logs, metrics, alerts)
6. **Notify stakeholders**
